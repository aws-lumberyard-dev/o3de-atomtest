        Summary:
        Enabling Grid, Shadow Catcher and Changing Background Image/Lighting works as expected

        Expected Result:
        The grid surrounding the model in viewport will toggle on, appearing as a grid under the model in viewport.
        The grid surrounding the model in viewport will toggle off, causing the grid underneath to disappear.
        Shadow Catcher toggles on, causing shadows below the cube to appear and disappear.
        The viewport background shifts from a cityscape to Greenwich Park.
        The mesh appearing in the viewport is set to Shader Ball. The mesh appearing in the viewport shifts
        from the previous model (Shader Ball) to a Cube shape.
